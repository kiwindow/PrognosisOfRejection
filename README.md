# PrognosisOfRejection
Clinical data used in the article concerning the analysis of prognosis of rejected renal graft

This respository has 3 files. 

1) rawdata.xsx
    This is the raw clinical data. There are 211 rows of explanatory variables and 1 row of target variable.
    The sample size is 51.
    
2) FinalResult.nb
    This file is written in Mathematica®. So Mathematica by Wolfram Research® is needed to read it.
    The URL of the company is as follows: https://www.wolfram.com/index.ja.html
    It contains final results of the analyses in creating predictive models of graft loss after rejection.
    The caliculation was mainly done with the software, DataModeler® by Evolved Analytics® that runs on Mathematica.
    The URL of this company is as follows: http://www.evolved-analytics.com/
    To reproduce the results in this file, DataModeler® is also needed.
    
3) DataModelerModelSets
    This file contains 11,540 models created by DataModeler®. 
    So to read in these models, DataModeler® is required.
